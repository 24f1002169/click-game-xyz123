## Overview

This is a simple circle click game. A circle appears at a random position on the screen. When the user clicks it, the circle moves to another random position. The game tracks the number of clicks, the average reaction time, and the time remaining. The game includes difficulty selection, where higher difficulties result in a smaller, faster-moving circle. When time runs out, the game ends and displays the final score. A reset button allows the player to restart the game.

## Setup

1.  Save the code as an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).
2.  Open the HTML file in a web browser.

## Usage

1.  The game starts automatically when the page loads.
2.  Select a difficulty level from the dropdown.
3.  Click the circle when it appears.
4.  The number of clicks, average reaction time, and time remaining are displayed below the game area.
5.  When the timer reaches zero, the game ends and displays the final score (number of clicks).
6.  Click the "Reset" button to restart the game.
